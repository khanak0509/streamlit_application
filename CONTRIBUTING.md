## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, whether you're a developer, a designer, or just a user with a good idea!

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please help us by reporting it. A good bug report should:

1.  **Check existing issues**: Before creating a new issue, please check if the bug has already been reported.
2.  **Provide clear steps to reproduce**: Describe the exact steps to consistently reproduce the bug.
3.  **Describe the expected behavior**: Explain what you expected the application to do.
4.  **Describe the actual behavior**: Explain what the application actually did.
5.  **Include your environment**: Specify your operating system, Python version, Streamlit version, and any other relevant dependencies.
6.  **Add screenshots or GIFs**: Visuals can be very helpful in understanding the issue.

You can open a new issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/chaitenyachand/streamlit_application/issues).

### Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? We'd love to hear it!

1.  **Check existing issues**: See if your suggestion has already been discussed.
2.  **Describe your idea clearly**: Explain what the enhancement is and why it would be beneficial.
3.  **Provide examples**: If possible, show how the enhancement would work or look.

You can open a new issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/chaitenyachand/streamlit_application/issues).

### Contributing Code

We welcome code contributions! Follow these steps to get started:

#### 1. Fork the Repository

First, fork the [streamlit_application repository](https://github.com/chaitenyachand/streamlit_application) to your own GitHub account.

#### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/streamlit_application.git](https://github.com/your-username/streamlit_application.git)
cd streamlit_application
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-issue-123
```

### 6\. Make Your Changes

  * **Coding Style**: Please adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
  * **Streamlit Best Practices**: Follow Streamlit's recommendations for building performant and user-friendly applications.
  * **Comments**: Add comments to your code where necessary to explain complex logic.
  * **Testing**: If applicable, add or update tests to cover your changes.

### 7\. Test Your Changes

Run the Streamlit application locally to ensure your changes work as expected:

```bash
streamlit run your_app_file.py # Replace with the actual main app file
```

### 8\. Commit Your Changes

Write clear and concise commit messages. A good commit message explains **what** changed and **why**.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature for X"
# or
git commit -m "fix: Resolve bug in Y component (#123)"
```

### 9\. Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 10\. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to the original `streamlit_application` repository on GitHub and open a new Pull Request from your branch.

  * **Describe your PR**: Clearly explain what your PR does, why it's needed, and any relevant details.
  * **Link to issues**: If your PR addresses an existing issue, link to it (e.g., `Closes #123`).
  * **Screenshots/GIFs**: Include visuals if your changes affect the UI.
